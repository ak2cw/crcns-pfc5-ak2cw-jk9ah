Data Exploration Project. 

This dataset (pfc-5) is from EEG signals, during a visuo-spatial working memory task. Ideally, we would like to look at the recordings
and analyze the differences between gender and/or procedure. We have extracted the EEG raw data for a subject for the 64 electrodes collecting data over time. We may end up using only some of the time stamps but for now we think it would make most sense to use all of the data for each part of the experiment. We may narrow down the amount of data by selecting random subjects to use in analysis. We also extracted the time stamps for those EEG data points and also trial info provided by the original researchers. Moving forward we will combine the data into one file or use them as is in other methods for analysis and possibly classification.
