Edit this file to describe how to retrieve the data set. Except for very small data files, it's not recommended to check data into version control.
We downloaded the data from the pfc-5 dataset for each trial and kept the .mat file. We renamed all the files to data_derived#.mat. We did this by downloading each file individually from the CRCNS website.
